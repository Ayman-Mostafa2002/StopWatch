# StopWatch
The Stop Watch system is implemented using an ATmega32 microcontroller running at a frequency of 1 MHz. Timer1 is configured in CTC mode to count the time. Six common anode 7-segment displays are connected using the multiplexing technique, controlled by a 7447 decoder. The decoder's 4 pins are connected to PORTC, and the first 6 pins of PORTA are used for enabling/disabling the displays. The stopwatch starts counting when power is connected to the MCU. External interrupts INT0, INT1, and INT2 are configured to detect falling edge, rising edge, and falling edge respectively. A push button with internal pull-up resistor is used for reset, a push button with external pull-down resistor is used for pause, and another push button with internal pull-up resistor is used for resume.
